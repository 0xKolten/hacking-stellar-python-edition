# üíª Hacking Stellar (Python Edition)

Hacking Stellar (Python Edition) is an open-source e-book on the basics of the Stellar network. It is very much based on and inspired by the e-book Hacking Stellar by 0xfe - except with an emphasis on Python üêç

**Prerequisites:**
  - [Basic Understanding of Stellar](https://www.lumenauts.com/courses/stellar-overview-course)
  - [Basic Understanding of Python](https://youtu.be/rfscVS0vtbw)  
  - Basic [JSON](https://youtu.be/iiADhChRriM) and [API](https://youtu.be/7YcW25PHnAA) knowledge

**Helpful resources:**
  - [Stellar.org Documentation](https://www.stellar.org/developers/guides/)
  - [Python Stellar SDK Documentation](https://stellar-base.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html)

**Important Note**: Many of the scripts written in each chapter are reused and repurposed in later chapters. Keeping them around will be useful as you go along and serve as good references down the road.

### What is Stellar?

Fundamentally, Stellar is a system for tracking ownership. It uses an accounting ledger, shared across a network of independent computers, to store two important things for every account holder: what they own (their account balances) and what they want to do with what they own (operations on those balances, like buy or sell offers.) - [Stellar.org](https://stellar.org/overview)
