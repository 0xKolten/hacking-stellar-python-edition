## Bonus Chapter - Streaming Horizon Data

One thing you may find useful when developing Stellar applications is the ability to stream data from Horizon. Examples of this can include streaming ledger data to your application or listening for transactions sent to an account.

I have already written a tutorial on how to stream data from the Stellar ledger that you can read [here](https://medium.com/@kolten/stream-ledger-data-from-the-stellar-network-using-python-861af04c40ab).

In this example I will be showing you how to listen for incoming transactions on an account.
