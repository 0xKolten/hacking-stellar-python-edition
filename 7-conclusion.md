## Chapter 7 - Conclusion & More Resources

If you've made it all the way to the end congrats! Hopefully this has been a useful journey for you and I've done a decent job at covering the basic concepts around the Stellar network.

That being said, this e-book is definitely not a fully exhaustive introduction. There's still a lot of material that wasn't covered here and many things to learn in order to *fully* wrap your head around Stellar.

Thankfully we have a ton of resources available that'll make your life easier.

**Suggested Reading**: I put together a list of awesome developer documentation, blogs, and tutorials [here](https://github.com/koltenb/awesome-stellar#developer-educational-resources). We also have a [Stellar Developers Blog](https://medium.com/stellar-developers-blog) and [Stellar.org](https://www.stellar.org) for official resources to go through.

**Community**: First and foremost if you have questions for me or suggestions on how to improve Hacking Stellar you can reach out on [Keybase](https://keybase.io/kolten). We also have a public Stellar Keybase team [here](https://keybase.io/team/stellar.public) with a channel dedicated to developer discussions. Lastly, feel free to look around and ask questions on the [Stellar Stack Exchange](https://stellar.stackexchange.com/) and [Galactic Talk](https://galactictalk.org/).

**Ecosystem**: Feel free to join the [Stellar Developer Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/stellar-dev) and take part in more technical discussions. You can also familiarize yourself with [CAPs](https://github.com/koltenb/stellar-protocol/tree/master/core), [SEPs](https://github.com/koltenb/stellar-protocol/tree/master/ecosystem), and [How Changes are Made to the Stellar Network](https://medium.com/stellar-community/how-changes-are-made-to-the-stellar-network-760abbb8d127). When you're ready dive in to the many available [Github repos](https://github.com/stellar) and put your skills to use where you see fit!

Good luck building the new financial infrastructure üëç
