## Chapter 5 - Path Payments on Stellar

<div align="center"><img width="25%" src="imgs/path-payment.png"></div>
<br>

For the official documentation on path payments - [go here](https://www.stellar.org/developers/guides/concepts/list-of-operations.html#path-payment).

Stellar's most unique feature is an operation called a ```Path Payment```. It allows users to send an asset through a path of offers, making it possible for the asset being sent (e.g. EUR) to be different from the asset received (e.g. USD).

To show off how path payments work, I'll make use of the STR token from last chapter. We will send lumens from ```Account B``` and have them converted to STR tokens by the time they arrive at ```Account A```'s address. 

### Finding a Payment Path

As I mentioned before, a path payment traverses a path of offers (up to 6) until it is converted to the desired asset. In order to make path payments easier to construct, we can execute a path search using the ```/paths``` Horizon endpoint and use the response to prefill the ```Path Payment``` operation. To specify a path search, we use the destination account id, the source account id, the asset and amount that the destination account should receive. Go [here](https://www.stellar.org/developers/horizon/reference/endpoints/path-finding.html#arguments) for the full list of ```/paths``` enpoint arguments.

Let's see how we can find a path between two assets. In this example I'll be using what is called a [Strict Receive Payment Path](https://www.stellar.org/developers/horizon/reference/endpoints/path-finding-strict-receive.html). A strict receive payment path allows a user to specify the amount of the asset being receieved. The amount sent will vary based on offers in the order books. The alternative is a [Strict Send Payment Path](https://www.stellar.org/developers/horizon/reference/endpoints/path-finding-strict-send.html) and is simply the opposite of what we're using. 

You can start by writing a script as so: 

``` python 
import requests
import json

def path_payment(sending_keypy, asset_code, asset_issuer, amount, receiving_key):
    # Create Horizon URL
    url = 'https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org/paths/strict-receive?source_account={}&destination_asset_type=credit_alphanum4&destination_asset_code={}&destination_asset_issuer={}&destination_amount={}&destination_account={}'

    # Get JSON response from Horizon
    r = requests.get(url.format(sending_key, asset_code, asset_issuer, amount, receiving_key))
    path_search = r.json()
    print(json.dumps(path_search, indent=2))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    str_issuer = 'GBEYFNS6KJRFEI22X5OBUFKQ5LK7Z2FZVFMAXBINC2SOCKA25AS62PUN'
    receiving_key = 'GBG7D5ZZJLAKPDBAGSVS3O3TMIV2O3HOIOXE2OSGGCYNRATOICDRTIAR'
    sending_key = 'GCF4PQGCOFR245LDPRMBDGMD7VQMOGF2KQZJAWICB6JJ337NDPUQR66E'
    path_payment(sending_key, 'STR', str_issuer, '5', receiving_key)
```

The information needed to execute a path search for a Strict Receive Path Payment includes: 
- The destination asset issuer (STR issuer) 
- The receiving address (```Account A```) 
- The sending address (```Account B```)
- The receiving amount (5 STR) 

After collecting the relevant info, we use it to fill in the Horizon URL we are getting a response from: 

``` python
url = 'https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org/paths/strict-receive?source_account={}&destination_asset_type=credit_alphanum4&destination_asset_code={}&destination_asset_issuer={}&destination_amount={}&destination_account={}'
```

The empty brackets ```{}``` are where the information mentioned previously will get included in the link via ```url.format(sending_key, asset_code, asset_issuer, amount, receiving_key)``` later in the script. For simplicity I chose to fill in the ```destination_asset_type=credit_alphanum4``` argument manually. ```credit_alphanum4``` is used to specify assets that are *not* luments. If lumens are the destination asset this would be changed to ```native```. 

From there, the script sends a ```GET``` request to the provided URL and should print a response like this when you run it: 

``` json
{
  "_embedded": {
    "records": [
      {
        "source_asset_type": "native",
        "source_amount": "9.9600000",
        "destination_asset_type": "credit_alphanum4",
        "destination_asset_code": "STR",
        "destination_asset_issuer": "GBEYFNS6KJRFEI22X5OBUFKQ5LK7Z2FZVFMAXBINC2SOCKA25AS62PUN",
        "destination_amount": "5.0000000",
        "path": []
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

When running path searches, you'll get a response of all of the available paths. In this example, there are orders available on the Stellar DEX that will allow ```Account B```'s lumens to be converted directly to the STR token on their journey to ```Account A```. So the ```path``` list will be empty. 

### Constructing a Path Payment

In order to actually build and submit a path payment our script will have to be a bit more robust. Instead of just printing the path search response to console, I'll instead use it to grab some relevant information. The script will also need the sending accounts signing key instead of public key, so that'll have to change as well in addition to adding all of the logic for building a transaction containing a path payment strict receive operation. 

With all of the new code added, it will look something like this: 
```python
from stellar_sdk import Server, Keypair, TransactionBuilder, Network
from stellar_sdk.xdr import Xdr
from stellar_sdk.xdr.StellarXDR_const import TransactionResultCode
import requests
import json
import base64

def tx_success(result_xdr):
    xdr_decoded = base64.b64decode(result_xdr.encode())
    unpacker = Xdr.StellarXDRUnpacker(xdr_decoded)
    xdr_obj = unpacker.unpack_TransactionResult()
    print('Transaction result:', TransactionResultCode.get(xdr_obj.result.code))

def path_payment(signing_key, asset_code, asset_issuer, amount, receiving_key):

    # Talk to testnet horizon instance
    server = Server(horizon_url="https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org")

    # Derive Keypair object and public key from the signing key (source account)
    source_keypair = Keypair.from_secret(signing_key)
    source_public_key = source_keypair.public_key

    # PATH SEARCH
    # Create Horizon URL
    url = 'https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org/paths/strict-receive?source_account={}&destination_asset_type=credit_alphanum4&destination_asset_code={}&destination_asset_issuer={}&destination_amount={}&destination_account={}'

    # Get JSON response from Horizon
    r = requests.get(url.format(source_public_key, asset_code, asset_issuer, amount, receiving_key))
    path_search = r.json()
    send_max = path_search['_embedded']['records'][0]['source_amount']
    path = path_search['_embedded']['records'][0]['path']

    # BUILD TRANSACTION
    # Fetch the current sequence number for the source account from Horizon.
    source_account = server.load_account(source_public_key)

    # Build transaction
    transaction = (
        TransactionBuilder(
            source_account=source_account,
            network_passphrase=Network.TESTNET_NETWORK_PASSPHRASE,
            base_fee=100,
        )
        .append_path_payment_strict_receive_op(destination=receiving_key, send_code='XLM', send_issuer=None, send_max=send_max, \
        dest_code=asset_code, dest_issuer=asset_issuer, dest_amount=amount, path=path, source=None)
        .build()
    )

    transaction.sign(source_keypair)

    # Submit the transaction to Horizon and check if successful
    response = server.submit_transaction(transaction)
    result_xdr = response.get('result_xdr')
    tx_success(result_xdr)
    print(json.dumps(response, indent=2))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # STR Issuing Address
    str_issuer = 'GBEYFNS6KJRFEI22X5OBUFKQ5LK7Z2FZVFMAXBINC2SOCKA25AS62PUN'
    
    # Account A Public Key
    receiving_key = 'GBG7D5ZZJLAKPDBAGSVS3O3TMIV2O3HOIOXE2OSGGCYNRATOICDRTIAR'
    
    # Account B Private Key
    signing_key = 'SCO4JEHDN2ZLIDZMZC62UR6Y5NICMTMRKBPG3JMBKI5AHVXJA46MY2VG'
    
    # Run path payment :) 
    path_payment(signing_key, 'STR', str_issuer, '5', receiving_key)
```
